# ðŸ”¢ Binary Addition Calculator (Logic Gate-Based)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview  
A simple binary calculator built using basic logic gates on a breadboard. It performs binary addition using full-adder circuits made from XOR, AND, and OR gates. The project helps understand the fundamentals of digital logic and computing.

## âœ¨ Features  
- Adds two 4-bit binary numbers  
- Binary input via DIP switches  
- Output displayed using LEDs  
- Built with full-adder logic (no microcontroller)  
- Real-time, hardware-based binary addition

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Components Used  
- Breadboard  
- DIP Switches  
- Logic Gate ICs (7486 - XOR, 7408 - AND, 7432 - OR)  
- LEDs  
- Resistors  
- Jumper wires  
- 5V power supply

## ðŸ“‹ Usage  
1. Set binary inputs using DIP switches  
2. Observe the output on LEDs  
3. Sum and carry bits are shown in real time  
4. Learn how full adders work in practice

## ðŸŽ¯ Educational Objective  
- Understand binary arithmetic  
- Explore logic gate operations  
- Implement full adder circuits  
- Practice hands-on digital electronics
